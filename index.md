Hello! :wave: I'm Anton, a network engineer with a background within the telecommunications industry and a passion for designing scalable networks and automating them. 

Since finishing university, I've worked at multiple Service Providers in various roles, primarily doing design/maintenance. Projects have included standardization of configurations, BGP & IGP migrations, building up a SoT for IaC (Infrastructure as Code), designing a new monitoring system and much more. The last few years my main focus has been on automation and making networks/processes scale.

On this website you'll also find an Archive which contains selected notes from my "Second Brain" - A way of organizing your life and improving productivity. 

When I'm not on the computer, I enjoy being outside in the nature and climbing. I also like riding two wheels and have undertaken 
overland trips in Asia on a bicycle and through Africa on a motorcycle.
