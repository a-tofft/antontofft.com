## A Second Brain
For more than 10 years, I have been documenting essentially everything in my life, from work related tasks, technologies to food recipes, Taxes, Entertainment and much more. This has allowed me to focus on being creative rather than memorizing unnecessary junk. Last year I found out about the concept of calling this a "Second Brain", a term coined by [Tiago Forte](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/). 

Around this time, I made the move from Microsoft OneNote to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for storing my notes. Obsidian is a simplistic note taking tool based on markdown files with support for plugins and has quickly become my most important tool for productivity. 

Majority of these notes remain private but I will slowly be publishing them below to share to the public. All pages on this site are markdown files, rendered into HTML using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
